    <h2>Designed for WebAssembly</h2>
    <p>AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly's feature set specifically, giving developers low-level control over their code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Familiar TypeScript syntax</h2>
    <p>Being a variant of TypeScript makes it easy to compile to WebAssembly without learning a new language.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Right at your fingertips</h2>
    <p>Integrates with the existing Web ecosystem - no heavy toolchains to set up. Simply `npm install` it!</p>
  </div>
